                           Email::Intestine
                           ================

This is a Perl module that implements basic email filtering.  It is
similar to Email::Filter but does not have any dependencies beyond
Perl itself and the modules that come with it.  It also consists of
only one file, so it is very easy to deploy without having to mess
around with the existing Perl installation.

Documentation is in the POD section of the file Intestine.pm.
